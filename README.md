### About Me
```python
class Programmer101:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "programmer1o1"
        self.role = "Hobby Coder"
        self.languages = ["hmmm idk"]
        self.fun_fact = "semicolon is real in python by the way"
    
    def say_hi(self):
        print("Thanks for dropping by!"); # this works by the way

me = Programmer101()
me.say_hi()
```

- I code for funâ€”just a hobbyist exploring the world one line at a time
- Something new to learn? Better try coding it!
- Currently learning: Whatever catches my interest today
